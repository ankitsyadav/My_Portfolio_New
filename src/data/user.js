	description: `I am a Backend & DevOps Engineer with over 3.5 years of experience building and operating
production-grade backend systems using Node.js and modern cloud infrastructure.

My work includes developing scalable microservices, low-latency APIs, and fintech workflows,
along with deploying and maintaining systems on AWS using EC2, S3, ECS, and Fargate.
I have worked with both container-based and serverless architectures depending on system requirements.

On the DevOps side, I actively work with Docker, GitHub Actions, Linux, Nginx, and cloud observability tools.
I have hands-on experience with Kubernetes for container orchestration and Terraform for
infrastructure provisioning and environment automation.

I value clean architecture, system thinking, and reliability, and I also enjoy mentoring engineers
and students on backend development, DevOps practices, and real-world deployment workflows.`,
